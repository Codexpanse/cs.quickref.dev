# Algorithm

### Layman (level 1)

A series of precise instructions that can be performed by a person or a computer. For example, [partial sums algorithm](http://everydaymath.uchicago.edu/teaching-topics/computation/add-partial-sums.html) for adding numbers.

Algorithms can be translated into code in a [programming language]("/p/programming-language").

### Beginner (level 2)

An unambiguous specification for performing calculation, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.

### Expert (level 3)

A [procedure]("/p/procedure") that can be implemented on a [Turing machine]("/t/turing-machine").
