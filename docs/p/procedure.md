# Procedure

### Layman (level 1)

A set of coded instructions that tell a computer or a computer program how to perform actions. On itself, a very vague term that can be applied broadly. Basically, any well-defined set of coded instructions can be called a procedure.

More often, this term is used to describe [procedural programming](/p/procedural-programming), which is a paradigm of programming that describes computer programs as series of inter-connected procedures.

The first major procedural programming languages first appeared circa 1960, including Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL and BASIC.

### Beginner (level 2)

Series of computational steps. Also known as routines and subroutines. Functions are considered procedures, too.

### Expert (level 3)

A sequence of program instructions, packages as an isolated unit. Intended for repeated calls in order to minimize code repetitions and to possible [abstract](/a/abstraction) away certain actions. In modern languages, [functions](/f/function) and [methods](/m/method) are examples of procedures.
